# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains a simple personal website for showcasing projects and providing information about yourself.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally. All files are static so you can also host them on any web server or GitHub Pages.

## Customization

1. Replace "Your Name" in the HTML files with your actual name.
2. Update the content of `about.html` with a brief bio.
3. Edit `projects.html` to list your own projects.
4. Update the featured project section in `index.html` with your favorite work.
5. Modify `styles.css` to change the look and feel as desired.

Enjoy building your portfolio!
